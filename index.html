    <p>In this blog post, we'll walk through the beginnning steps to set up a Digital Ocean Droplet.</p>

        <p>Step 1: Purchasing a Domain</p>
        
    <p>  Before you can start developing your droplet, it's best to buy a domain name first. You can do so by going to sites such as,https://domains.google/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw3ueiBhBmEiwA4BhspDChqoJLcVR-zspglA6vqjLWdA_RLe5iL1vUSSn2ABRU3JZyy5n5kRoChokQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds, https://www.namecheap.com/, or any other domain purchasing site. AI generators such as CHATGPT can help you to come up with a domain name you can then look up and purchase if available.  </p>
        
       <P> Step 2: Setting up the Droplet</p>
        
      <p>  For this droplet I recommend the following:</p>
    <p> 
        Chose the Region in which you live: IE New York
        A datacenter within that Region
        Your chosen terminal, I use Ubuntu 
        A droplet size, regular is great for afforability! Do not opt in for the $4/month CPU size, instead go for at least the $6 option to avoid problems in the furture.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Next you are going to want to chose a password if you are not familiar with SSH keys. This password is crucial to being written down. A strong password contains three memorable words and a number. For example: FlowerApple76Cow. You can then carry the theme of Plant,Fruit,76,Animal for furture passwords in this project. 
    </p>
    <p>Step 3: Coding Your Droplet</p>

<p> 
    Now you are ready to start coding your droplet! Digital Ocean has a great tutorial to walk you through step by step code to get your site up and running. Your first step starts here!
    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-20-04#prerequisites 
</p>
    <p> 
        The second step in this process is LAMP installation. DO NOT follow step one. Rather follow this tutorial https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-22-04 and pick back up at step two on LAMP installation.
    </p>
    <p>Step 4: Advice for Success</p>
      <p>
        Your droplet may not be successsful the first go around, and that's okay! You can easily destroy your droplet and start over. The key to having a successful run at creating a droplet is to keep track of where you are, don't miss any steps, and don't be discourage to start over. Most importantly, you don't want to start over just becuase you forgot your password, so have a document with all your information, and copy paste that password into your terminal to avoid misspelling. YOU WILL NOT SEE THE PASSWORD WRITTEN OUT BUT ITS THERE!
